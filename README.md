# Check-MK plugin for monitoring adsl lines
This Check checks status of an ADSL line via the SNMP ADSL-LINE-MIB. Written for and tested with a DrayTek Vigor165, should work on other DrayTek ADSL routers/modems and probably with other hardware (feedback is welcome). If want to try this with other Hardware than Vigor165/Vigor130, you will need to adjust the snmp_scan_function.
New Version (>1.1) requires CMK >2.0.0! If you use an older version, look in the v0.7 branch.
